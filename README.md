# Inference-Aware FLUID Summarization
This repository implements Inference-Aware FLUID (IFLUID), a research prototype that enhances the FLUID knowledge graph summarization framework by selectively encoding logical inferences into compact feature representations, rather than explicitly materializing them in the graph structure.

The goal is to preserve semantic completeness while maintaining scalability and compactness, enabling efficient downstream learning (e.g., GNN-based node classification) on large knowledge graphs.
